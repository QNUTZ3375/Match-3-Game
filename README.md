Note: openJDK 17 may need to be installed for the application to work properly

Manual:

- 0-9: switch to any level from 1 to 9 (0 doesn't have a lavel, it's a placeholder)
- Left Arrow: move down a level
- Right Arrow: move up a level

Debugging:
- h: print the first valid move within a level
- s: shuffle the pieces around

After completing the level, press any key to move to the next level, the highest level is level 9 as adding any more levels isn't necessary to showcase the functionality of the program.

I made this program as a challenge to implement shape transformations and animations, as well as my own algorithm to handle falling pieces within a game format, hence the choice to make a match-3 game.
